#MilitaryTime
=============

This is a simple C program to spit out military time. All it really does is parse the timezone offset into Nautical letters and then builds the date time in a standard military format.

##Build Instructions
====================

Since this doesn't have a Makefile, maybe do something like 'gcc -o militarytime militarytime.c'. Then run the executable. So simple.
